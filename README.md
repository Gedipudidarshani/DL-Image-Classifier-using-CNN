# DL-Convolutional Deep Neural Network for Image Classification

## AIM
To develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) classification model for the given dataset.

## THEORY
The MNIST dataset consists of 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9), each of size 28Ã—28 pixels. The task is to classify these images into their respective digit categories. CNNs are particularly well-suited for image classification tasks as they can automatically learn spatial hierarchies of features through convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.

## Neural Network Model
Include the neural network model diagram.

## DESIGN STEPS
### STEP 1: Import all the required libraries (PyTorch, TorchVision, NumPy, Matplotlib, etc.).

### STEP 2: Download and preprocess the MNIST dataset using transforms.

### STEP 3: Create a CNN model with convolution, pooling, and fully connected layers.
### STEP 4: Set the loss function and optimizer. Move the model to GPU if available.
### STEP 5: Train the model using the training dataset for multiple epochs.

### STEP 6: Evaluate the model using the test dataset and visualize the results (accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report, sample prediction).
